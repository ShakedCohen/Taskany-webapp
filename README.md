# Taskany
Free Open Source task management and kanban web app for teams.

## Stack
### Back End
Flask (Python), Jinja, MongoDB (with MongoEngine)
### Front End
Vanilla JS

## Purpose of this project
I started working on Taskany for two reasons. First, I wanted to get a grasp of developing a web app with flask. Second, I wanted to create a free kanban-like solution for my team, which could run off our own server.

### Contribution
Yes please! Feel free to jump in. I would love to hear your comments and accept your contributions. There are many features yet to be implemented, and I want to refactor at least some of the current codebase. There is much to be done. I'm aware of some issues I want to work on, but also welcome any input.

### Deployment
You can clone the project and run it off of any server you like. While the flask server will work, it's recommended to use a more robust solution like nginx.
